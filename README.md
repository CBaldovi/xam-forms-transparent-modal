# Transparent Modal pages in Xamarin Forms (demo on iOS only)

This is a sample on how to create transparent modal dialogs in a Xamarin Forms application using custom pages and page renderers. 

This sample is focusing on overcoming the UI limitations of Xamarin forms not on application architecture. 
As a result the custom page and renderer class introduces a significant tradeoff: they would not rely on Xamarin Forms page stack, this problem is completely ignored here.
